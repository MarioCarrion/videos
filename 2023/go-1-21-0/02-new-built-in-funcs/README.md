# New built-in functions: min, max and clear.

Excerpt from official release notes:

> Go 1.21 adds three new built-ins to the language.

> * The new functions min and max compute the smallest (or largest, for max) value of a fixed number of given arguments. See the language spec for details.

> * The new function clear deletes all elements from a map or zeroes all elements of a slice. See the language spec for details.
