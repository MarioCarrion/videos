Also known as **Pub/Sub**, this messaging pattern allows customers, known as `subscribers`, to asynchronously receive events generated by a producer, known as a `publisher`. **Pub/Sub** is a well-known pattern used in distributed systems to asynchronously communicate different services interested in knowing specific information about a particular service.

In Go, we can use the concurrency primitives of the language, such as channels and goroutines, to implement this pattern.

## What's a simpler way to read a channel when only one is used?

I asked this question in the final part of the video, the answer is to remove `select` and use the `for` directly, so something like this inthe go routine:

```
		for val := range s1 {
			fmt.Println("sub 1, value ", val)
 		}

		fmt.Print("sub 1, exiting\n")

		wg.Done()
```
